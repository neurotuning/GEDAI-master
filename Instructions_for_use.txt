Basic instructions for using the GEDAI plugin for EEGLAB

* Step 1: We recommend high-passing the data before GEDAI denoising (e.g. > 0.5 Hz or > 1 Hz).  
In the GUI, go to **Tools -> Filter the data -> Basic FIR filter** and set the "Lower edge of the frequency pass band (Hz)" to 0.5 or 1 Hz.

* Step 2: In the GUI, go to **Edit -> Channel locations**, to import channel labels/locations.  
Make sure a) EEG channel labels (e.g. "Fp1", "Fz", etc without any trailing characters) or b) EEG channel locations (e.g. XYZ coordinates) are present in the EEG.chanlocs structure. 

* Step 3: Launch the GEDAI plugin. For the leadfield matrix type, depending on Step 2 above, a) use option "precomputed", for b) use option "interpolated".
